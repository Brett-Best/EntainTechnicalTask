Has the pace to take a forward position. Hard to beat. SOPHIA TOTO (1) was safely held on debut last start, finishing 33 lengths behind the winner in fifth over 1200m at this track. Will take a lot from that experience. One of the main contenders. SARAH LUNA (4) stepped out on her debut over 1400m at this track three-and-a-half weeks ago and finished fifth, beaten 35 lengths. Better for that run and can improve sharply.",
